# Hello-World

Howdy All!
I'm babyprogrammer04 from VA. 
I'm restarting my java journey. 
I brought a boatload of courses from Java Code Geeks.
Hopefully its not to old since Java 14 has come out already.  
Wish me luck!

I'm not entirely sure, so I'm making the computer print this out.

System.out.println("Hello-World!");
